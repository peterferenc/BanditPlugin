# BanditZombiePlugin

A RocketMod plugin for Unturned that spawns AI "bandit" bots: they appear as real player
characters, hold an Eaglefire, continuously turn to face the nearest player, and shoot at them.

Despite the project name (which started life as a zombie-based experiment), bots are **fake
players**, not zombies. See "Why not zombies?" below.

## Commands

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/bandit` | `banditzombie.spawn` | Spawns a bandit where you're looking, facing you. |
| `/banditclear` (alias `/clearbandits`) | `banditzombie.spawn` | Removes all spawned bandits. |

Use `/banditclear` before disconnecting - bots occupy player slots, and their presence affects
the client-side exit timer.

## How it works

Four pieces:

- **`FakeTransportConnection`** - a no-op `ITransportConnection`, so `Provider.addPlayer` has a
  non-null connection to register for a client that doesn't exist.
- **`FakePlayerSpawner`** - reflects into `Provider.ClaimNetIdBlockForNewPlayer` / `addPlayer` /
  `Player.InitializePlayer` / `SendInitialPlayerState`, mirroring the sequence `Provider` uses for
  a real join. Then gives the bot an Eaglefire and attaches the controller.
- **`PlayerJoinBroadcaster`** - sends the `PlayerConnected` message and initial player state to
  every already-connected client. **`addPlayer` alone does no networking at all** (it only fires a
  local C# event), so without this the bot exists server-side but nobody's client renders it.
- **`BanditBotController`** - each tick, builds a `WalkingPlayerInputPacket` and enqueues it on the
  bot's own `PlayerInput.serversidePackets`. Vanilla `PlayerInput` then drives everything -
  `look.simulate` (rotation), `movement.simulate`, `equipment.simulate` (trigger), the animator,
  and the `clock`/`tock` cadence that paces firing.

## Non-obvious things this had to work around

Each of these was found by decompiling the server's real `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, and each one
produced a silent failure rather than an error:

1. **The server does not raycast bullets.** `UseableGun.ballistics()` applies damage from hit
   reports the *owning client* sends (`PlayerInput.sendRaycast(info, ERaycastInfoUsage.Gun)`);
   with no client, `if (!player.input.hasInputs()) break` discards every bullet. Symptom: the bot
   fires convincingly and damages nothing at all - not players, not trees. The controller now
   raycasts itself and injects an `InputInfo` into the packet's `serversideInputs`.
2. **Firing before the gun is equipped throws punches.** `PlayerEquipment.simulate` routes primary
   attacks to `simulate_PunchInput` while there's no valid useable, and ignores input until
   `IsEquipAnimationFinished`. Attack input is gated on both.
3. **`ServerEquip()` silently no-ops** if the player is momentarily `life.isDead` / `!canEquip`
   right after spawn - so some bots stood around holding nothing. It's now retried until it takes.
4. **`startPrimary()` refuses to fire while firemode is SAFETY.** Firemode lives in
   `equipment.state[11]` and ammo in `state[10]`, both read by `UseableGun.equip()`, so they must
   be set on the item *before* it is equipped.
5. **`analog = 0` means "walk backwards"**, not "stand still". Input is decoded as
   `((analog >> 4) & 0xF) - 1`, so neutral is `0x11`.
6. **`SteamPlayerID` overloads `operator==` without a null guard** - it dereferences both sides. A
   plain `steamPlayer.playerID == null` check throws `NullReferenceException`.
7. **A nested type that is `public` inside an `internal` type reports `IsPublic == false`.**
   `NetMessages.ClientWriteHandler` must be looked up with `BindingFlags.Public | NonPublic`;
   `NonPublic` alone silently returns null.
8. **Bots are kicked after ~30s** by `Provider.KickClientsWithBadConnection` unless
   `SteamPlayer.timeLastPacketWasReceivedFromClient` is refreshed, since they never receive packets.
9. **RocketMod's global event handlers assume every player is one it set up.** Rocket subscribes to
   statics like `PlayerLife.OnTellHealth_Global`, which fire for *every* player, then opens each
   handler with an unguarded `GetComponent<UnturnedPlayerEvents>()`. Rocket only attaches that
   component from its `Provider.onServerConnected` hook, which a bot never triggers - so every time
   a bot was shot, starved or grew thirsty the log filled with `NullReferenceException`, and the
   throw unwound back through `PlayerLife.doDamage` into `UseableGun.ballistics`, skipping whatever
   vanilla did after telling health. Fixed by attaching the same three components Rocket does
   (`UnturnedPlayerFeatures`, `UnturnedPlayerMovement`, `UnturnedPlayerEvents`). Note this also
   makes a bot spawn raise Rocket's `OnPlayerConnected` for other plugins.

## Why not zombies?

The original plan was a custom zombie. Two hard blockers killed it:

- Zombies are synced to a client **once**, when that client's map region first loads
  (`ZombieManager.onBoundUpdated` + a one-shot `regions[bound].isNetworked` flag). There is no
  vanilla RPC that introduces a *new* zombie ID to an already-loaded client - even
  `ReceiveZombieAlive` requires `id < regions[reference].zombies.Count` on the client's existing
  list. A zombie added mid-session is permanently invisible to anyone already there.
- `Zombie.rightHook` (the bone mega zombies parent their boulder to) is declared but **never
  assigned anywhere**, and has no `[SerializeField]`. There's no working attachment point for a
  persistent held item.

Players have neither problem: joins are broadcast unconditionally and are the most
heavily-exercised path in the game.

## Build

1. Copy `Directory.Build.props.example` to `Directory.Build.props` and set:
   - `UnturnedManagedPath` - the server's `Unturned_Headless_Data/Managed` folder.
   - `RocketModPath` - the folder with `Rocket.API.dll`, `Rocket.Core.dll`, `Rocket.Unturned.dll`.
2. `dotnet build BanditZombiePlugin.csproj -c Release`

## Install

1. Copy `bin/Release/BanditZombiePlugin.dll` into the server's `Rocket/Plugins/` folder.
2. Start once to generate `BanditZombiePlugin.configuration.xml`.
3. Grant `banditzombie.spawn` to a group in `Rocket/Permissions.config.xml`.

Developed against Unturned 3.26.3.8 with RocketModFix 4.23.1.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GunAssetGuid` | Eaglefire's GUID | Resolved by GUID because `Assets.find(EAssetType.ITEM, name)` is case-sensitive and the asset is `Eaglefire`, not `EagleFire`. |
| `GunAssetLegacyId` | `4` | Fallback if the GUID doesn't resolve. |
| `MagazineCapacity` | `30` | Also the refill amount for `InfiniteAmmo`. |
| `FireIntervalSeconds` | `0.6` | One trigger pull per interval. |
| `AimToleranceDegrees` | `10` | Won't fire until aimed this close. |
| `FireRange` | `50` | See the range limitation below. |
| `AimHitChance` | `0.3` | Roughly the fraction of shots that land. `1` restores perfect aim. |
| `AimTargetRadius` / `AimTargetHalfHeight` | `0.35` / `0.8` | Ellipse standing in for the player's hitboxes, used to solve for the aim error. |
| `AimMaxErrorDegrees` | `8` | Caps the error, so the bot doesn't flail at point-blank range. |
| `AimWobbleIntervalSeconds` | `0.35` | How often the aim re-drifts between shots. |
| `AimWobbleSmoothingSeconds` | `0.15` | Larger is a lazier sway; `0` snaps. |
| `RequireLineOfSight` | `true` | Bot won't target or shoot through walls, rocks or vehicles. |

### Accuracy

The bot's aim error is drawn in **metres at the target's range** and then converted to an angle, so
the hit rate holds steady with distance instead of the bot being lethal up close and hopeless far
out. Each axis' standard deviation is scaled by that axis' half-extent, which puts the miss (in
target-widths) on a circular unit Gaussian, so `P(hit) = 1 - exp(-1 / 2s²)` and `AimHitChance` is
met at `s = 1 / sqrt(-2 ln(1 - p))`. A fresh sample is drawn the instant the trigger is pulled, so
shots are independent; the drift between shots is just cosmetic sway.

Measured against the ellipse, that lands on 30% from about 10m out. Closer in, the
`AimMaxErrorDegrees` clamp takes over and the bot gets deadlier - ~43% at 5m, ~54% at 3m.

## Known limitations

- **~50m effective range.** With Ballistics enabled the server only accepts a hit report within
  roughly `ballisticTravel * (steps + 1 + SAMPLES) + 4` (≈54m for the Eaglefire) of the bullet at
  report time. Longer range would mean delaying the hit report as the bullet travels.
- **Line of sight is eye-to-eye.** A target whose head is behind cover reads as hidden even if a
  leg is exposed, and vice versa - the bot won't shoot at a sliver of a player it can technically
  see. Mirrors what vanilla sentry guns do.
- **Bots are stationary** - they turn and shoot but never move. Movement would require
  reproducing client-side movement prediction so `clientPosition` matches the server.
- **Bots consume player slots** and appear in the player list and server browser count.
- Reflection into private members means a game update can break this; failures name the specific
  member in the server log.

## Credits

Approach informed by [EvolutionPlugins/Dummy](https://github.com/EvolutionPlugins/Dummy) (MIT,
© 2022 DiFFoZ) - specifically driving bots via `serversidePackets` input packets and the
`timeLastPacketWasReceivedFromClient` keep-alive. No code was copied; that project has no weapon
support (`// todo: simulate useable`), so the equipping and firing here is original.
