# Why not zombies?

The original plan was a custom zombie. Two hard blockers killed it:

- Zombies are synced to a client **once**, when that client's map region first loads
  (`ZombieManager.onBoundUpdated` + a one-shot `regions[bound].isNetworked` flag). There is no
  vanilla RPC that introduces a *new* zombie ID to an already-loaded client - even
  `ReceiveZombieAlive` requires `id < regions[reference].zombies.Count` on the client's existing
  list. A zombie added mid-session is permanently invisible to anyone already there.
- `Zombie.rightHook` (the bone mega zombies parent their boulder to) is declared but **never
  assigned anywhere**, and has no `[SerializeField]`. There's no working attachment point for a
  persistent held item.

Players have neither problem: joins are broadcast unconditionally and are the most
heavily-exercised path in the game.
