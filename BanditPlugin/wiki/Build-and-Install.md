# Build & install

## Build

1. Copy `Directory.Build.props.example` to `Directory.Build.props` and set:
   - `UnturnedManagedPath` - the server's `Unturned_Headless_Data/Managed` folder.
   - `RocketModPath` - the folder with `Rocket.API.dll`, `Rocket.Core.dll`, `Rocket.Unturned.dll`.
2. `dotnet build BanditPlugin.csproj -c Release`

Pathfinding references three more assemblies out of the same Managed folder:
`AstarPathfindingProject.dll`, plus `PackageTools.dll` and `Drawing.dll` for the base classes
`Seeker` inherits from (`VersionedMonoBehaviour` and `MonoBehaviourGizmos`). All three ship with
the server and are already loaded by the game, so nothing extra is deployed.

## Install

1. Copy `bin/Release/BanditPlugin.dll` into the server's `Rocket/Plugins/` folder.
2. Start once to generate `BanditPlugin.configuration.xml`.
3. Grant `bandit.spawn` - and `bandit.team` if you want `/banditteam` - to a group in
   `Rocket/Permissions.config.xml`.

Developed against Unturned 3.26.3.8 with RocketModFix 4.23.1.
