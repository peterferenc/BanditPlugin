# Known limitations

- **~50m effective range.** With Ballistics enabled the server only accepts a hit report within
  roughly `ballisticTravel * (steps + 1 + SAMPLES) + 4` (≈54m for the Eaglefire) of the bullet at
  report time. Longer range would mean delaying the hit report as the bullet travels.
- **Line of sight is eye-to-eye.** A target whose head is behind cover reads as hidden even if a
  leg is exposed, and vice versa - the bot won't shoot at a sliver of a player it can technically
  see. Mirrors what vanilla sentry guns do.
- **Movement is 8-way.** `input_x`/`input_y` are only ever -1, 0 or 1, so a walking direction is
  quantised into 45° sectors. It's invisible while travelling (the body turns onto the line of
  travel) but a strafing bandit in combat moves in 45° steps.
- **Pathfinding only exists inside Nav volumes.** Outside them the bot steers directly, so it can
  be led into a dead end that whiskers and stuck-sidestepping can't reason its way out of; it
  gives up on the goal rather than grinding.
- **Bots consume player slots** and appear in the player list and server browser count.
- Reflection into private members means a game update can break this; failures name the specific
  member in the server log.
