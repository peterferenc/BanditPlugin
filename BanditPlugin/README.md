# BanditPlugin

A RocketMod plugin for Unturned that spawns AI "bandit" bots: they appear as real player
characters, hold an Eaglefire, continuously turn to face the nearest player, and shoot at them.

The project started life as a zombie-based experiment, but bots are **fake players**, not
zombies. See "Why not zombies?" below.

## Commands

| Command | Permission | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `/bandit` | `bandit.spawn` | Spawns a bandit where you're looking, facing you. |
| `/banditgoto` (alias `/bgoto`) | `bandit.spawn` | Sends the last spawned bandit to the point you're looking at (up to 512m). |
| `/banditpatrol [on\|off]` | `bandit.spawn` | Starts/stops **all** bandits patrolling this map's waypoints. No argument toggles. |
| `/banditwp add\|remove\|clear\|list` | `bandit.spawn` | Records this map's patrol route at your feet. |
| `/banditcover` | `bandit.spawn` | Makes the last spawned bandit take cover from you now, and reports what it found. |
| `/banditstop` | `bandit.spawn` | All bandits hold fire. They still move and track you. |
| `/banditshoot` | `bandit.spawn` | Weapons free again. |
| `/banditstatus` | `bandit.spawn` | What each bandit is doing - state, target, destination, A* or steering. |
| `/banditclear` (alias `/clearbandits`) | `bandit.spawn` | Removes all spawned bandits. |

Use `/banditclear` before disconnecting - bots occupy player slots, and their presence affects
the client-side exit timer.

## How it works

Four pieces:

- **`FakeTransportConnection`** - a no-op `ITransportConnection`, so `Provider.addPlayer` has a
  non-null connection to register for a client that doesn't exist.
- **`FakePlayerSpawner`** - reflects into `Provider.ClaimNetIdBlockForNewPlayer` / `addPlayer` /
  `Player.InitializePlayer` / `SendInitialPlayerState`, mirroring the sequence `Provider` uses for
  a real join. Then gives the bot an Eaglefire and attaches the controller.
- **`PlayerJoinBroadcaster`** - sends the `PlayerConnected` message and initial player state to
  every already-connected client. **`addPlayer` alone does no networking at all** (it only fires a
  local C# event), so without this the bot exists server-side but nobody's client renders it.
- **`BanditBotController`** - each tick, builds a `WalkingPlayerInputPacket` and enqueues it on the
  bot's own `PlayerInput.serversidePackets`. Vanilla `PlayerInput` then drives everything -
  `look.simulate` (rotation), `movement.simulate`, `equipment.simulate` (trigger), the animator,
  and the `clock`/`tock` cadence that paces firing.

and, for movement:

- **`BanditBrain`** - the state machine (Idle / Travel / Investigate / Engage / TakeCover). It
  publishes a desired *world* direction plus stance flags and never touches packets itself.

  **Combat does not steer the feet.** Taking cover is the single tactical override; everything
  else a bandit does while fighting - aiming, firing, tracking - happens in the controller and
  leaves movement alone. So a patrol or a `/banditgoto` keeps running through a firefight instead
  of being suspended by it. Closing on a target and investigating a last known position are both
  opt-in config, off by default, because each one makes the bot abandon what it was told to do.
- **`BanditNavigator`** - turns "go here" into a direction, via A* where there is a navmesh and
  whisker steering where there isn't.
- **`BanditCoverFinder`** - generates and scores positions that break line of sight from a threat.
- **`BanditWaypointStore`** - per-map patrol routes in `Waypoints/<map>.txt`.

## Movement, cover and patrol

### Movement is two more bytes on the packet

No positions are ever written. The server decodes movement out of the same packet the bot was
already sending and simulates it with the real `CharacterController`:

```csharp
int input_x = ((analog >> 4) & 0xF) - 1;   // -1 / 0 / 1
int input_y = (analog & 0xF) - 1;
player.movement.simulate(sim, recov, input_x, input_y, 0f, 0f, keys[0] /*jump*/, keys[5] /*sprint*/, RATE);
```

so gravity, slopes (`Max_Walkable_Slope`), step-up, stairs, per-surface friction, stamina, water
and region updates all come free, and position replicates to other clients exactly as a real
player's does. `keys` is a bitfield of `1 << index`: bit0 jump, bit3 crouch, bit5 sprint.

**Movement is body-relative, and the body yaw *is* the aim yaw.** `PlayerLook.simulate` assigns
`transform.localRotation` from the packet's yaw (both components live on the player's root
GameObject), and `PlayerMovement` then does `transform.rotation * move.normalized * speed`. So a
desired world direction has to be un-rotated by the yaw *that same packet carries* and quantised
onto the eight compass points. The upshot is that an engaged bandit strafes and backpedals with
its gun still on the target, and only turns its body when it has nobody to shoot at.

### Pathfinding: the server is already running A*

Unturned ships `AstarPathfindingProject.dll`, and `UnturnedPathfinding_ASPFP` creates a live
`AstarPath` singleton with one `RecastGraph` per Nav volume - that's what zombies path on
(`Seeker` + `FunnelModifier` + `LegacyAIPathNoRedist`). The navigator borrows the Seeker and the
funnel modifier but **not** the AIPath: AIPath drives `transform` directly, which would fight
`PlayerMovement` and desync the position other clients see. Only the corner list is used.

The navmesh only exists *inside* Nav volumes, i.e. the towns where zombies spawn, so a bandit on
the roads between them is off-mesh most of the time. Each repath checks whether both endpoints
snap onto a graph (within `NavmeshSnapDistance`, because AstarPath's own
`maxNearestNodeDistance` is 100m and would happily snap onto the next town's graph); if not, the
bot steers directly, with capsule-cast whiskers fanning out to either side of a blocked path,
a jump for obstacles that are only blocking low down, and vanilla-zombie-style stuck detection
that sidesteps and eventually gives up so the brain can pick another goal.

### Cover

Candidates come from the landmarks actually near the bot - trees, rocks, vehicles, walls,
barricades - plus a blind ring of samples for terrain folds and building corners no collider
points at.

For each landmark the spot is found by **raycasting from the threat's eye at the landmark** and
standing just behind wherever that ray first hits. The obvious alternative - `bounds.center` plus
the bounding box's half-extent - is wrong in exactly the case cover most obviously has to handle:
a tree's bounds are its *canopy*, three to five metres across, so the spot lands that far behind a
trunk 0.3m wide, where the trunk no longer occludes anything. Every tree then fails the
"still visible when crouched" test and is discarded, and the bot stands in the open having found
"no cover" with a tree right in front of it. Each survivor is scored on the same `BLOCK_SENTRY`
visibility test the bot's own line of sight uses, so "in cover" means exactly "can't be shot":

| Result | Meaning |
|---|---|
| visible when crouched | not cover, rejected |
| hidden crouched, visible standing | **crouch cover** - the prize: duck to be safe, stand to shoot |
| hidden either way | hard cover - safe but silent, unless a lateral step gives a firing angle |

The bot's current position is scored with the same function and used as the bar to beat, so one
already tucked behind a rock doesn't keep sprinting between equally good rocks. A hurt bandit
flips the weighting and hides properly instead of looking for a firing position.

Once there it alternates hiding and exposing itself (`CoverHideSeconds` / `CoverPeekSeconds`) -
crouching and standing in crouch cover, stepping out to the verified flank in hard cover. Note the
bot **keeps fighting while it has no visible target**: crouching is what breaks line of sight, and
the controller only acquires players it can see, so cover runs on memory for a few seconds rather
than the bot standing up and wandering off mid-firefight.

Getting shot by someone it never saw is handled through `DamageTool.damagePlayerRequested`, whose
`direction` points along the bullet - so the bot knows roughly where to hide from, and where to go
looking afterwards.

### Patrol

`/banditwp add` records waypoints at your feet into `Waypoints/<map>.txt` (plain `x y z` lines,
hand-editable). With no recorded route, patrol falls back to the map's `LocationDevkitNode`s - the
named places official maps mark in the editor. Bandits start at whichever waypoint is nearest,
loiter on arrival, and break off to fight anything they see on the way, resuming afterwards.

## Non-obvious things this had to work around

Each of these was found by decompiling the server's real `Assembly-CSharp.dll`, and each one
produced a silent failure rather than an error:

1. **The server does not raycast bullets.** `UseableGun.ballistics()` applies damage from hit
   reports the *owning client* sends (`PlayerInput.sendRaycast(info, ERaycastInfoUsage.Gun)`);
   with no client, `if (!player.input.hasInputs()) break` discards every bullet. Symptom: the bot
   fires convincingly and damages nothing at all - not players, not trees. The controller now
   raycasts itself and injects an `InputInfo` into the packet's `serversideInputs`.
2. **Firing before the gun is equipped throws punches.** `PlayerEquipment.simulate` routes primary
   attacks to `simulate_PunchInput` while there's no valid useable, and ignores input until
   `IsEquipAnimationFinished`. Attack input is gated on both.
3. **`ServerEquip()` silently no-ops** if the player is momentarily `life.isDead` / `!canEquip`
   right after spawn - so some bots stood around holding nothing. It's now retried until it takes.
4. **`startPrimary()` refuses to fire while firemode is SAFETY.** Firemode lives in
   `equipment.state[11]` and ammo in `state[10]`, both read by `UseableGun.equip()`, so they must
   be set on the item *before* it is equipped.
5. **`analog = 0` means "walk backwards"**, not "stand still". Input is decoded as
   `((analog >> 4) & 0xF) - 1`, so neutral is `0x11`.
6. **`SteamPlayerID` overloads `operator==` without a null guard** - it dereferences both sides. A
   plain `steamPlayer.playerID == null` check throws `NullReferenceException`.
7. **A nested type that is `public` inside an `internal` type reports `IsPublic == false`.**
   `NetMessages.ClientWriteHandler` must be looked up with `BindingFlags.Public | NonPublic`;
   `NonPublic` alone silently returns null.
8. **Bots are kicked after ~30s** by `Provider.KickClientsWithBadConnection` unless
   `SteamPlayer.timeLastPacketWasReceivedFromClient` is refreshed, since they never receive packets.
9. **RocketMod's global event handlers assume every player is one it set up.** Rocket subscribes to
   statics like `PlayerLife.OnTellHealth_Global`, which fire for *every* player, then opens each
   handler with an unguarded `GetComponent<UnturnedPlayerEvents>()`. Rocket only attaches that
   component from its `Provider.onServerConnected` hook, which a bot never triggers - so every time
   a bot was shot, starved or grew thirsty the log filled with `NullReferenceException`, and the
   throw unwound back through `PlayerLife.doDamage` into `UseableGun.ballistics`, skipping whatever
   vanilla did after telling health. Fixed by attaching the same three components Rocket does
   (`UnturnedPlayerFeatures`, `UnturnedPlayerMovement`, `UnturnedPlayerEvents`). Note this also
   makes a bot spawn raise Rocket's `OnPlayerConnected` for other plugins.

## Why not zombies?

The original plan was a custom zombie. Two hard blockers killed it:

- Zombies are synced to a client **once**, when that client's map region first loads
  (`ZombieManager.onBoundUpdated` + a one-shot `regions[bound].isNetworked` flag). There is no
  vanilla RPC that introduces a *new* zombie ID to an already-loaded client - even
  `ReceiveZombieAlive` requires `id < regions[reference].zombies.Count` on the client's existing
  list. A zombie added mid-session is permanently invisible to anyone already there.
- `Zombie.rightHook` (the bone mega zombies parent their boulder to) is declared but **never
  assigned anywhere**, and has no `[SerializeField]`. There's no working attachment point for a
  persistent held item.

Players have neither problem: joins are broadcast unconditionally and are the most
heavily-exercised path in the game.

## Build

1. Copy `Directory.Build.props.example` to `Directory.Build.props` and set:
   - `UnturnedManagedPath` - the server's `Unturned_Headless_Data/Managed` folder.
   - `RocketModPath` - the folder with `Rocket.API.dll`, `Rocket.Core.dll`, `Rocket.Unturned.dll`.
2. `dotnet build BanditPlugin.csproj -c Release`

Pathfinding references three more assemblies out of the same Managed folder:
`AstarPathfindingProject.dll`, plus `PackageTools.dll` and `Drawing.dll` for the base classes
`Seeker` inherits from (`VersionedMonoBehaviour` and `MonoBehaviourGizmos`). All three ship with
the server and are already loaded by the game, so nothing extra is deployed.

## Install

1. Copy `bin/Release/BanditPlugin.dll` into the server's `Rocket/Plugins/` folder.
2. Start once to generate `BanditPlugin.configuration.xml`.
3. Grant `bandit.spawn` to a group in `Rocket/Permissions.config.xml`.

Developed against Unturned 3.26.3.8 with RocketModFix 4.23.1.

## Configuration

| Key | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GunAssetGuid` | Eaglefire's GUID | Resolved by GUID because `Assets.find(EAssetType.ITEM, name)` is case-sensitive and the asset is `Eaglefire`, not `EagleFire`. |
| `GunAssetLegacyId` | `4` | Fallback if the GUID doesn't resolve. |
| `MagazineCapacity` | `30` | Also the refill amount for `InfiniteAmmo`. |
| `FireIntervalSeconds` | `0.6` | One trigger pull per interval. |
| `AimToleranceDegrees` | `10` | Won't fire until aimed this close. |
| `FireRange` | `50` | See the range limitation below. |
| `AimHitChance` | `0.3` | Roughly the fraction of shots that land. `1` restores perfect aim. |
| `AimTargetRadius` / `AimTargetHalfHeight` | `0.35` / `0.8` | Ellipse standing in for the player's hitboxes, used to solve for the aim error. |
| `AimMaxErrorDegrees` | `8` | Caps the error, so the bot doesn't flail at point-blank range. |
| `AimWobbleIntervalSeconds` | `0.35` | How often the aim re-drifts between shots. |
| `AimWobbleSmoothingSeconds` | `0.15` | Larger is a lazier sway; `0` snaps. |
| `RequireLineOfSight` | `true` | Bot won't target or shoot through walls, rocks or vehicles. |
| `MovementEnabled` | `true` | Master switch. Off makes bandits the stationary turrets they used to be. |
| `ArriveRadius` | `2` | How close counts as arrived. |
| `RepathIntervalSeconds` | `2.5` | How often a moving bot asks A* for a fresh path. |
| `NavmeshSnapDistance` | `3` | Beyond this from the navmesh the bot steers directly instead of pathing. |
| `AllowSprint` / `AllowJumping` | `true` | Vanilla still gates sprint on stamina and aiming. |
| `AdvanceOnTarget` | `false` | Walk toward a target further away than `PreferredEngagementRange`. A chase behaviour - off by default, and only applies when the bot has no order or patrol. |
| `InvestigateEnabled` | `false` | After losing contact, go and look at the last known position. Also off by default: it makes the bot leave its post. |
| `DespawnSecondsAfterDeath` | `5` | How long a killed bandit lies there before removal. Negative leaves the body for `/banditclear`. |
| `PreferredEngagementRange` | `25` | Range the bot fights at, and scores cover against. |
| `CoverEnabled` | `true` | Seek cover when seen or shot at. |
| `CoverSearchRadius` | `18` | Radius searched for cover. |
| `CoverSearchIntervalSeconds` | `3` | Minimum gap between searches - each is a burst of raycasts. |
| `CoverRingSamples` | `12` | Blind samples per ring, on top of nearby colliders. |
| `CoverMinimumThreatDistance` | `8` | Cover nearer the threat than this is ignored. |
| `CoverHideSeconds` / `CoverPeekSeconds` | `2.5` / `2` | The duck-and-pop cycle. |
| `PatrolByDefault` | `false` | Start newly spawned bandits patrolling. |
| `PatrolWaypointDwellSeconds` | `3` | Loiter time at each waypoint. |
| `PatrolLoop` | `true` | Return to the first waypoint after the last. |
| `PatrolUseLocationNodesWhenNoWaypoints` | `true` | Fall back to the map's location nodes. |

### Accuracy

The bot's aim error is drawn in **metres at the target's range** and then converted to an angle, so
the hit rate holds steady with distance instead of the bot being lethal up close and hopeless far
out. Each axis' standard deviation is scaled by that axis' half-extent, which puts the miss (in
target-widths) on a circular unit Gaussian, so `P(hit) = 1 - exp(-1 / 2s²)` and `AimHitChance` is
met at `s = 1 / sqrt(-2 ln(1 - p))`. A fresh sample is drawn the instant the trigger is pulled, so
shots are independent; the drift between shots is just cosmetic sway.

Measured against the ellipse, that lands on 30% from about 10m out. Closer in, the
`AimMaxErrorDegrees` clamp takes over and the bot gets deadlier - ~43% at 5m, ~54% at 3m.

## Known limitations

- **~50m effective range.** With Ballistics enabled the server only accepts a hit report within
  roughly `ballisticTravel * (steps + 1 + SAMPLES) + 4` (≈54m for the Eaglefire) of the bullet at
  report time. Longer range would mean delaying the hit report as the bullet travels.
- **Line of sight is eye-to-eye.** A target whose head is behind cover reads as hidden even if a
  leg is exposed, and vice versa - the bot won't shoot at a sliver of a player it can technically
  see. Mirrors what vanilla sentry guns do.
- **Movement is 8-way.** `input_x`/`input_y` are only ever -1, 0 or 1, so a walking direction is
  quantised into 45° sectors. It's invisible while travelling (the body turns onto the line of
  travel) but a strafing bandit in combat moves in 45° steps.
- **Pathfinding only exists inside Nav volumes.** Outside them the bot steers directly, so it can
  be led into a dead end that whiskers and stuck-sidestepping can't reason its way out of; it
  gives up on the goal rather than grinding.
- **Bots consume player slots** and appear in the player list and server browser count.
- Reflection into private members means a game update can break this; failures name the specific
  member in the server log.

## Credits

Approach informed by [EvolutionPlugins/Dummy](https://github.com/EvolutionPlugins/Dummy) (MIT,
© 2022 DiFFoZ) - specifically driving bots via `serversidePackets` input packets and the
`timeLastPacketWasReceivedFromClient` keep-alive. No code was copied; that project has no weapon
support (`// todo: simulate useable`), so the equipping and firing here is original.
